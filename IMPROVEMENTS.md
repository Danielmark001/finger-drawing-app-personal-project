# Finger Drawing App - Improvements Overview

## Dynamic Eraser Size Based on Distance

The updated application now features a dynamic eraser size that changes based on the distance of your palm from the camera:

- **Closer to camera** → Larger eraser (up to 80px radius)
- **Further from camera** → Smaller eraser (as small as 15px radius)
- **Visual feedback** indicates current eraser size and distance

### How it works:

1. The application measures the width of your palm in the image
2. A wider palm in the frame indicates you're closer to the camera
3. The eraser size is dynamically scaled based on this distance
4. Visual feedback is provided with color-coded indicators (red = far, green = close)

## Enhanced User Interface

The interface has been completely redesigned for a better user experience:

- **Welcome screen** on startup with visual instructions
- **Help overlay** (press 'h' key) with detailed usage instructions
- **Visual gesture guides** that highlight active hand parts
- **Status bar** with current mode and tool information
- **Improved visual feedback** when changing settings or saving
- **Semi-transparent UI elements** that don't obscure the drawing area

## Improved Palm Detection

The palm detection algorithm has been enhanced to be more accurate:

- **Multiple criteria** are used to detect palm orientation:
  - Finger extension (at least 3 fingers must be extended)
  - Palm orientation (palm must be facing the camera)
  - Finger spread (fingers must be spread apart, not clenched)
  
- This reduces false detections and makes palm erasing more reliable

## Additional Visual Enhancements

- **Brush preview** shows the actual size and color being used
- **Color swatch** displays the current color more prominently
- **Eraser preview** shows the actual area that will be erased
- **Distance indicators** show when your palm is at optimal distance
- **Visual feedback** for all operations (saving, clearing canvas, etc.)

## Usage Improvements

- **Startup guidance** helps first-time users understand the app
- **Clearer instructions** in both the UI and help overlay
- **Better keystroke feedback** for all operations
- **Save confirmation** shows the filename when drawings are saved
